Add the `@sentry/react-native` dependency:

```npm
npm install --save @sentry/react-native
```

```yarn
yarn add @sentry/react-native
```

Run `@sentry/wizard`:

```bash
npx @sentry/wizard -i reactNative -p ios android

cd ios
pod install
```

<Note>

For React Native 0.68 and older you will have to manually patch the Xcode project. Read more at the [Manual Configuration](/platforms/react-native/manual-setup/manual-setup/) page.

</Note>

[Sentry Wizard](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-wizard) will patch your project accordingly, though you can [setup manually](/platforms/react-native/manual-setup/manual-setup/) if you prefer. You need to do this only once, then the created files can go into your version control system.

The following changes will be performed by Sentry Wizard:

- enable the Sentry React Native Gradle build step for Android to auto upload generated source maps and debug symbols
- wrap _Bundle React Native code and images_ Xcode project build phase script to upload generated source maps and collect bundled node modules
- add _Upload Debug Symbols to Sentry_ Xcode project build phase
- store build credentials in _*ios/sentry.properties*_ and _*android/sentry.properties*_.
- configure Sentry for the supplied DSN in your _*App.tsx*_ file
- wrap your _App_ for [touch event tracking](/platforms/react-native/touchevents/) and [automatic performance monitoring](/platforms/react-native/performance/instrumentation/automatic-instrumentation/)

### Expo

If you are using Expo, see [How to Add Sentry to Your Expo Project](https://docs.expo.io/guides/using-sentry/). This SDK works for both managed and bare projects.

<Note>

Make sure that the version of `@sentry/react-native` matches what `sentry-expo` depends on, [read more on our troubleshooting page](/platforms/react-native/troubleshooting/#expo).

</Note>

### iOS Specifics

When you use Xcode, you can hook directly into the build process to upload debug symbols and source maps. However, if you are using bitcode, you will need to disable the “Upload Debug Symbols to Sentry” build phase and then separately upload debug symbols from iTunes Connect to Sentry.

### Android Specifics

For Android, we hook into Gradle for the source map build process. When you run `react-native link`, the Gradle files are automatically updated. When you run `./gradlew assembleRelease` or `./gradlew bundleRelease`, source maps are automatically built and uploaded to Sentry.

If you have enabled Gradle's `org.gradle.configureondemand` feature, you'll need a clean build, or you'll need to disable this feature to upload the source map on every build.

To disable this feature, set `org.gradle.configureondemand=false` or remove it as its default value is disabled, do this in the `gradle.properties` file.
